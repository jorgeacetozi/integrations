Prometheus Integration
======================

== Description ==

This integration allows you to configure Prometheus endpoints to scrape in the agent if you are using Prometheus
exporters or services that have a Prometheus endpoint.

== Metrics Collected ==

The metrics collected will depend entirely on the endpoint being scraped. All metrics with the correct type and 
labels will be collected by default.
