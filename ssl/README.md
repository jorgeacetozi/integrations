SSL Integration
===============

== Description ==

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a clientâ€”typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client.

This integration will monitor your SSL certificates by collecting their expiration time.

Once enabled you will get a default SSL dashboard to help you get started monitoring your SSL certificates.

== Metrics Collected ==

|Metric Name       |Type   |Labels         |Unit|Description                                       |
|------------------|-------|---------------|----|--------------------------------------------------|
|ssl.days_remaining|Gauge  |ssl_cert_source|day |The SSL certificate remaining days for expiration.|

== Installation ==

Just run the SSL plugin against your hosts and it will start collecting metrics.
